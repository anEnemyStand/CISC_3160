For Lab 3, I chose to work on implementing Sorting Algorithms using Python and Ruby.
The Sorting Algorithms implemented are Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Shell Sort
The code is organized by having each sorting algorithm residing in their own function.
An unsorted array is set up to test each sorting algorithm by passing the array into each function's argument.
In each sorting function, the array is printed to the screen both before and after the sort.
Since this printing code is repeated over and over, it is also made into a function.
