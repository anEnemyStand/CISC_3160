Lab 3
Reflection

	Learning Python and Ruby in such a short time was overall not as hard as I would imagine. 
There definitely was difficulty, but overall it was a lot easier than learning C++, the first 
language I learned. I assume it was easier this time because I understood the logic of the
 code better, and switching the language was more of dealing with little differences in ways
 of expressing the same thing. The most challenging part of the Lab for me was the 
Pseudo-code as I wanted to make sure I understood it concretely enough to translate it into
 new different languages. It had been a while since I last programmed these sorting 
algorithms, so it felt like a refresher, but also a deeper dive into the logic behind each sort. 
The next hardest part was the Python code. Since it was the first one I decided to tackle, 
there was a lot more time spent on it. Ruby on the other hand was very fast, since I found 
there to be many similarities between it and Python. Thinking in another language was 
interesting and appealing. At one point I thoughts were in Python, and in another my 
thoughts were in Ruby. Switching how I would tackle a problem depending on the language
 was challenging at first, but became easier as time spent on the lab increased.
